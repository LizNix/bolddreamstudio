						<p>As a web developer managing a team of other web developers I recognized a need for a WordPress starter theme integrating bootstrap that still lets a coder code. The main advantages of Bootscores are:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>It's built on underscores so sane defaults are set for standard WordPress features and nothing to get in the way of development.</li>
							<li>It loads the bootstrap framework from the bootstrap CDN. So you have access to all bootstrap’s CSS and JavaScript components without having to serve them on your hosting environment.</li>
							<li> It integrates Justin Weaver's Flexnav so multiple level drop downs are easy to add and hover drop down on desktop works out of the box.</li>

						<p>My client needed a quick and cost effective site for her dog breeding and showing services, so we got her up and running in less than a week on this WordPress site with a customized child theme. One of the main goals was to give her maximum control for updates and it was almost two years between launch and her need to contact me for maintenance because she was able to keep the site ruining smoothly with regular updates on her own.</p>

						<p>In a previous incarnation, liznix.com housed a site detailing my web services but when I was in a full time agency position and raising a family I routinely had to turn away leads from the site for lack of time. I decided that I wanted my vanity URL to house more personal content, so in early 2015 I started from scratch to give myself a blog that would include not just my experiences in web design but my other passions as well: writing, art, and musings on motherhood and life in general.</p>

						<p>If you've read this far then the behind the scenes on this very project merits some explication. Now that I’m working independently once again I needed a new site to showcase my abilities. It brings together all of the best practices I’ve learned along the way as well as some principles I’ve been waiting for an opportunity to implement and experiment with. It’s a static site. I strated with text content then formatted it with semantic mark up and progressively built the design in browser, all on a self-managed server. Feedback is welcome and appreciated.</p>

				<h1>Education &amp; Experience</h1>
				<p>I studied psychology, architecture, fine art and digital art in college. I started at the Santa Rosa Junior College and transferred to Dominican University of California where I graduated Magna Cum Laude in 2006 with a BA in Digital Art, emphasis in Web Design.</p>
				<p>Since then I've worked at 2 web development agencies for a total of 7 years, with freelance work in between. I have played a significant role in the creation of hundreds of web projects with responsibilities including design and development, ecommerce configuration, email marketing, SEO, project management, marketing strategy, hosting and email configuration.</p>
				<p>Currently I am working with the amazing team at <a href="http://www.onedaylabs.com">One Day Labs</a> as account manager and maintenance lead in addition to independent contract work.</p>

				<h1>Professional Development Strategy</h1>
				<p>This industry moves fast and no matter where you are on the path there is always more to learn. New and better web technologies are always emerging, and they are used most effectively by those who put the work into developing core strength, so I prioritize keeping current while constantly deepening foundational knowledge. The following is my personal road map to get myself to the next level.</p>
				<h2>Currently Learning</h2>
				<p><strong>JavaScript</strong> - bringing javascript competency up to advanced level through online courses and hands on experience  in Javascript, followed by the frameworks AngularJS and ReactJS.</p>
				<p><strong>PHP</strong> - bringing PHP competency to advanced level with online courses and continued hands-on experience.</p>
				<p><strong>Accessibility</strong> - Learning how mark up is interpreted by accessibility technology and using this very website as a testing ground to make sure my code is compliant and easy to parse for all users. Plans for improvement include completing <a href="https://webaccessibility.withgoogle.com/course">Google's accesisbility course</a> and using online tools to test for compatibility with assistive techonologies.</p>
				<p><strong>SysAdmin</strong> - Accelerating my systems administration learning by hosting my own sites on Digital Ocean and managing the servers there.</p>
				<h2>Next Steps</h2>
				<p><strong>Ruby</strong> - bringing Ruby competency to novice and then intermediate levels with online courses in Ruby and Ruby on Rails and utilizing this knowledge in the creation of custom Shopify Apps and other projects.</p>
